TODO:



Issues:
    - csg sets parent (immutable)
        how to enforce this

    - shape transform/material is immutable
        hard to set later on, especially if in a group
        how to deal with equals (all fields, or without group, or without transforms)

    - performance:
        parallelize group divide algorithm

    - issues:
        share obj files between groups

- mesh normalization
    http://forum.raytracerchallenge.com/thread/27/triangle-mesh-normalization


    add name to shape
        load name in yaml
        load name in obj

    idea:
        split shape into
            a node (path, children, parent)
            and a immutable/sharable primitive
